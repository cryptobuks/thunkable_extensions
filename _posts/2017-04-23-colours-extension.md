### HexToRGB {#h2r}

The <span class="block procedure">Colours1.HexToRGB</span> block takes a #HEX colour and converts it into a lisp list in the format (R G B). 

![h2r](http://domhnallohanlon.com/thunkable_extensions/assets/post_assets/colours_extension/colours_h2r.png)

Note that you must include the # symbol otherwise the missing character will generate a runtime error such as <code>length=6; regionStart=5; regionLength=2</code>

### RGBToHEX {#r2h}

The <span class="block procedure">Colours1.RGBToHex</span> block takes a lisp list and converts it to a #HEX format number.

###Â Lighten & Darken {#landd}

Both the lighten and darken blocks require two input aruments. 
The **colour** input expects a list in the form (R G B), rather than an integer as an input.
The **amount** input expects an input anywhere between 0 and 1.

The lighten and darken blocks return a (R G B) list, so if you want to apply this as a text or background colour somewhere in your app make sure you pass it through a <span class="block split">make color</span> block, which you can find in the colours category of blocks, but you have to remove the <span class="block list">make a list</span> block first. 

Here are two basic examples of using the lighten and darken procedures.

### Mix Colours {#mix}

In keeping with the previous blocks, the inputs for this block, <code>ColourA</code> and <code>ColourB</code> are (R G B) lists, and the <code>amount</code> argument accepts a number anywhere between 0 and 1.

The example below shows how use either a default colour or a custom colour as an input and mix them together. 

Again, the return type from this block is a (R G B) list so don't forget to pass it through a <span class="block split">make color</span> block if you want to use it to assign a colour to a component in your design.
