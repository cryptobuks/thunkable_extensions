## Writing a Post

Start by creating a copy of this template post, you can use it, and existing posts, as a reference for your own post. The naming convention for articles is YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-your-post.filetype, so for example this file is `2017-01-01-template.md`.

If you are a new contributor your posts should be added to the `_drafts` directroy so that the can be reveiwed before being added to the site. Posts that are approved are added to the `_posts` directory where they can be indexed and added to the website.

## Front Matter

## Images

A picture paints a thousand words and, especially for users who are not native English speakers, the more visual aids you can provide the better. When creating a post for this site you can specify an **optional** feature image, that gets displayed on the home pages and you can add images directly to your article. 

### Feature Image

The feature image is specified in the yaml at the very to of the post using the image attriude. The path to all visual assets will begin `assets/post_assets/` followed by the directory you are using and the file name you want to load. 

```yaml

---
image: assets/post_assets/YOUR_FOLDER/YOUR_IMAGE.png
---

```


### In-line Images

If you are writing a markdown file you can use valid markdown or HTML.

```markdown

![Image Title](assets/post_assets/YOUR_FOLDER/YOUR_IMAGE.png)

```

You can also use html

```html
<img src="assets/post_assets/YOUR_FOLDER/YOUR_IMAGE.png">

```
