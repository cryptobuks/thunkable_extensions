## Overview

Extensions are very easy to add to your Thunkable apps - there are only a simple few steps.

#### Step 1
Navigate to <a href="http://app.thunkable.com">app.thunkable.com</a> and login using your Google Account.
<br>
You should now see a screen with this at the top:

#### Step 2
Open an exising project or create a new one.
<br>
To create a new project, click the "Create New App" button at the top of the screen, just under the Thunkabe logo.

#### Step 3
Find the extension you want to import into your app. There is a full list of Thunkable extensions on our <a href="http://domhnallohanlon.com/thunkable_extensions/">homepage</a>

#### Step 4
Either:
<ul>
<li>Download the extension (.aix file) to your computer</li>
<li>Copy the direct download link to the extension to your clipboard</li>
</ul>

#### Step 5
At the left-hand side of the screen, you will see a pallete like this:
<img src="http://domhnallohanlon.com/thunkable_extensions/assets/post_assets/how_to_add_extensions/Step5.png" alt="pallete">
<br>
Select the "Extension" label, you will then see a button that says "<i>Import Extension</i>"

#### Step 6
Click the "<i>Import Extension</i>" button. You will see a pop-up box like this:

#### Step 7
If, in Step 4, you downloaded the extension to your computer, click the "Choose File" button.
<br>
If you copied the direct link, select the "URL" button in the pop-up and paste the link into the textbox.

#### Step 8
Click the "Import" button

#### Step 9
After clicking the "Import" button, you should see a pop-up asking you to rename the extension.
I recommend you leave the name as it is and click "OK". You can rename it if you wish to, though.

#### Step 10
Your extension will now show as a component in the pallete.

#### Step 11
To use the component in the app, do what you would do with any normal component. Click and drag the extension into the work area.

#### Step 12
You will now see the extension as a non-visible component in your app.
