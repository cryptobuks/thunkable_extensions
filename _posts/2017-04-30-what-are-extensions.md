## Overview

Thunkable is limited in the number of components it has to offer and users may want to use components in their apps which Thunkable doesn't provide. This is the reason extension components were introduced - so that users can create their own components and use them in their apps. Extensions <b>currently</b> only allow non-visible components to be added to apps which means functions that work without the user being able to see it on the screen will work.
